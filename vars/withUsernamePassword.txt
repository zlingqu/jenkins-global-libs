Get the username and password from a stored Jenkins credentials and pass to a closure.
Example:
```groovy
withUsernamePassword(credentialsId: 'the-creds-id') { username, password ->
  // Do something with the username and password...
}
```
This is a syntactic sugar on-top of the `withCredentials` basic step.

**Arguments:**
* `credentialsId` (string) -
  the ID of the username & password credentials to use, which was pre-configured in the Jenkins instance
